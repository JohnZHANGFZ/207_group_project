As it starts to dry, cut through the paste in a crisscross pattern, allowing air to penetrate as much as possible. Protect the paste from insects with a storm or screen window, a piece of cheesecloth, or netting. A day or two of hot sun will dry the mixture to where you can scrape it off the cookie sheets and form into nonsticky small balls. Oven drying: 140~ about 7 hours Dehydrater: until you can form into nonsticky balls Let the balls dry a day more at room temperature, and store them in a tightly lidded jar.

Here's a great way to keep what's left over. Using a hand-held can opener, open both ends of can, discard one. Using the stem of a spoon as a plunger against the other end, push paste out, in its original shape, onto a piece of plastic wrap. Score the paste into Tablespoon-size pieces (most cans contain 6 - 8 Tablespoon worth sizes). Gently roll the plastic around the paste and freeze. When you need a single Tablespoon, just cut off a frozen slice."}]
